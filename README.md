# example_architecture

This is a demo project for my personal best practices for an application architecture.
It is not an architecture for every use case but for some of the bigger projects I've been working on. 
It also doesn't mean I always take all of these patterns.

It is meant for demonstrating what I write about in my blog post ["Android Architecture - personal best practices"](https://t.co/kKpADYslLv).
